What is quilt? â€” another static site generator
----------------------------------------------
Generate a static site via python from content-only html and markdown pages that are stitched together along with patch (e.g. nav.html, footer.html) files onto a main site quilt.html file.

### Why? 
Cause there's a bunch of other static site generators already!

#### BecauseI wanted...
1. specific features 2. something I didn't see in others 3. to improve python fluency 4. homegrown customization

### Notable features

- [x] write content in html or markdown
- [x] extensible markdown for custom needs
- [x] LATEX Support

- [x] provide some dynamic blogy abilities (reverse chronology, tags, categories)
- [x] create atom/rss feeds
- [x] index the text of final site for searching (e.g. with typeahead)
- [ ] potential for nltk integration
